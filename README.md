scoreboard
==========

A work in progress.

Developers
----------

To add dummy data, run:

```
npm run add-dummy-data
```

To access all dummy data scores for the dummy game, make a GET request to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:7676/games/1/scores
```

Obviously replacing `127.0.0.1:7676` with the respective hostname and port.
